## Requirements

STM32CubeIDE integrates STM32 configuration and project creation functionalities from STM32CubeMX to offer all-in-one tool experience and save installation and development time. After the selection of an empty STM32 MCU or MPU, or preconfigured microcontroller or microprocessor from the selection of a board or the selection of an example, the project is created and initialization code generated. At any time during the development, the user can return to the initialization and configuration of the peripherals or middleware and regenerate the initialization code with no impact on the user code.

## Instllation 

It can be linked and  installed for various IDE of your choice , STM IDE is recommended. 

## Usage

It supports various IoT smart applications and learning extension modules to be connected with.
